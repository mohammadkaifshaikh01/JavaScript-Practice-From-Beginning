# Animal Image Selector

## Description
The **Animal Image Selector** is a simple, interactive web-based application that allows users to select an animal from a dropdown menu and displays a corresponding image. It demonstrates the dynamic updating of content using JavaScript and serves as an educational example for beginners learning HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Features
- **Dropdown Menu**: A dropdown menu with options for different animals (Dog, Lion, Elephant, Cat).
- **Dynamic Image Display**: Displays the selected animal's image dynamically.
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized layout that adapts to various screen sizes.
- **Default Message**: Shows a friendly message when no valid option is selected.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For the structure of the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling and responsive design.
- **JavaScript**: For handling user interactions and dynamically changing the displayed image.

## How It Works
1. The user selects an animal from the dropdown menu.
2. The JavaScript function `changeimage()` is triggered.
3. Based on the selected value:
   - The corresponding animal's image is displayed in the image container.
   - If no valid option is selected, a default message is shown.
4. Previous content in the image container is cleared before adding new content.

## Setup and Usage
1. Clone or download the repository.
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/mohammadkaifshaikh01/JavaScript-Practice-From-Beginning.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
4. Interact with the dropdown menu to see the images of selected animals.

## Project Files
- **index.html**: Contains the structure of the webpage.
- **styles**: Internal CSS for styling the application.
- **script**: Internal JavaScript for dynamic content handling.

## Example Usage
- **Select Dog**: Displays an image of a dog.
- **Select Lion**: Displays an image of a lion.
- **Select Elephant**: Displays an image of an elephant.
- **Select Cat**: Displays an image of a cat.
- **Default**: Displays a friendly message when no animal is selected.

## Future Enhancements
- Add more animals to the dropdown menu.
- Use an external stylesheet for better maintainability.
- Enhance the visual appearance with animations and transitions.
- Implement a fallback image in case the image URL fails to load.
